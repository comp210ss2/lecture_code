## Solutions branch

Some files in the `main` branch are purposely incomplete to allow students to write code in lecture. My solutions are in the `solutions` branch.

You can switch branch on GitHub by clicking the branch button at the top left (should say `main` by default). Or, in IntelliJ, use Git > Branches. Or, in your terminal, `git checkout solutions`.

## Fork and clone instructions

If you clone this repo directly, you will not have write access so won't be able to push to this repo (to back up your code to GitHub), only commit locally on your own computer. This would save your history but only locally, and it won't be backed up to GitHub.

Instead, you will need to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository to create a copy of this repo under your own name (i.e., the name will be `<your_github_username>/lecture_code`). To fork, go to this repo on GitHub and click the fork button at the top right. Then clone your forked repo.

Since it will be your repo, you will have write access. You will also be able to "sync fork" (using the "sync fork" button on GitHub) then `git pull` to pull changes from this "upstream" repository.
